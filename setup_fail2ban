Fail2ban reads .conf configuration files first,
then .local files override any settings.
Because of this, all changes to the configuration
are generally done in .local files,
leaving the .conf files untouched.


Copy file to fail2ban.local:

cp /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local


The jail.conf file will enable Fail2ban for SSH by
default for Debian and Ubuntu, but not CentOS. 
All other protocols and configurations (HTTP, FTP, etc.)
are commented out. If you want to change this, create a jail.local 
for editing:

cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

To ignore specific IPs, add them to the ignoreip line.
By default, this command will not ban the localhost. 
If you work from a single IP address often, 
it may be beneficial to add it to the ignore list:

bantime: The length of time in seconds for which an IP is banned.
If set to a negative number, the ban will be permanent. 
The default value of 600 is set to ban an IP for a 10-minute duration.

findtime: The length of time between login attempts before a ban is set. 
For example, if Fail2ban is set to ban an IP after five (5) 
failed log-in attempts, those 5 attempts must occur 
within the set 10-minute findtime limit. 
The findtime value should be a set number of seconds.

maxretry: How many attempts can be made to access 
the server from a single IP before a ban is imposed. 
The default is set to 3.
